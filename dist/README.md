# CV site

My content added to the theme.
More documentation will come soon.

## Contributing

If you see anything odd, please file an issue or submit a pull request.
An ambition of mine is to make the site very accessible, so any help around that is extra appreciated.

## License

Images in the Media section are linked to Wikimedia Commons where their license is detailed. If you need to use them in another way, please contact me and we can probably work something out.
